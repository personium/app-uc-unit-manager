# Unit Manager  
Unit Manager is a GUI tool that helps manage Personium Cells on any Personium Unit.  

## Preparation  
If you want to have your own copy, 
No installation or compilation, you only need to upload the modules to your web server.  
For example, if you have constructed your own [1-server unit](https://github.com/personium/ansible/blob/master/1-server_unit/1-server_unit.jpg), you can upload the modules to your Nginx's server folder.  

# A simple use case  
Perform the following procedures to create a folder and upload a file to the folder. Then, delete the file and the folder.
